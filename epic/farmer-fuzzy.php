			<h3>Persona:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Age: 32 years old</li>
				<li>Occupation: Professional farmer who makes their living selling their goods at farmers markets and also by selling their produce straight from their farm.</li>
				<li>Products: Farmer Fuzzy grows tomatoes, potatoes, kale, radishes, corn, mushrooms, zucchini, carrots, eggplant, and grapes. He also raises chicken and has 3 cows who produce enough milk for him and his customers.</li>
				<li>Goals: Farmer Fuzzy loves selling his goods at farmers markets but wants more people to reserve his goods before the market opens because he often sells out which angers some of his frequent customers. He also wants more people to realize that they can come buy his produce from his farm, and is willing to put together packages for them.</li>
				<li>Needs from an online farmers market (Roots 'n Table): Farmer Fuzzy <strong>NEEDS</strong> to get his products and name online so more people can buy his goods. He hopes to spread his business to a bigger portion of the community and wishes that people will see the benefit of buying local.</li>
				<li>Relevant technology: Farmer Fuzzy has an old laptop that runs Windows XP. He is hoping that with the increased customer base he can upgrade to a MacBook Pro 15.4 inch retina display that runs the latest and greatest version of Mac OS X.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Use Case:</h3>
			Farmer Fuzzy wants to register and sign up for an account on Roots 'n Table so that he can sell his goods to the general public. He realizes that a lot of the time most people are browsing through the farmers market while periodically checking their phones so he hopes that the site is mobile friendly. Also, he wants to reach the people who might not have the opportunity to go to a farmers market. He is currently running an old laptop but will be upgrading soon so he hopes the sight looks sharp on new technology. He will be updating a lot of information from his home in between harvesting and will be taking pictures of his crops when they look nice and pretty.
