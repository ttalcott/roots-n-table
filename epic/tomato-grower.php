			<h3>Persona:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Age: 20 years old</li>
				<li>Occupation: works as an administrative during the day but has a knack for growing tomatoes and raising chickens.</li>
				<li>Products: Madison grows incredible tomatoes and raises 15 chickens in her back yard in her spare time. Right now she doesn't do anything with any of her products but she would like an easy way to share them with the world (and maybe make a little money).</li>
				<li>Goals: Madison wants to share her delicious tomatoes and eggs from her chickens with more people than her and her boyfriend and occasionally her parents. She wants to do so in a format she, as a millennial, can relate with such as a virtual farmers market.</li>
				<li>Needs from an online farmers market (Roots 'n Table): Madison needs for an online farmers market to be easy to use and look nice. She is very picky about UX so if it doesn't look nice and sharp she won't use it. Ever. She also needs to be able to easily upload her information and products onto the farmers market site because she works all day and doesn't have time to search through several tabs to upload anything.</li>
				<li>Relevant technology: Madison primarily uses her iPhone 6s to do everything. Literally EVERYTHING. She owns a laptop but only uses it for her job. The rest of the time it is sitting on a shelf collecting dust (makes sense... it is a dell).</li>

			<h3>Use Case:</h3>
			<p>
				Madison wants to use Roots 'n Table mainly on her iPhone 6s since that's what she always uses anyways. She wants to sell her tomatoes and eggs to people who will appreciate her products and she is not really trying to make too much money off of her venture. She will be uploading information on her down time from work which is a short period of time which means it must be easy to do. She doesn't want to wrestle with making an account or navigating the site either considering her limited amount of time so she expects the UI to be clean and polished.
