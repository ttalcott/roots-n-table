			<h3>Persona:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Age: 57 years old</li>
				<li>Occupation: Used to be a marketing wizard but now she enjoys volunteering her time to good causes.</li>
				<li>Goals: Erica is a true farmers market frequent flyer: she goes to many markets every week. However, she always runs into the problem that many of her favorite products are sold out by the time she gets there. She hopes to find a solution that allows her to reserve and pay for her favorites ahead of time so that she can have a guarantee that she will get what she wants. She also hopes that the site is easy to use because, well, she doesn't technology.</li>
				<li>Needs from an online farmers market (Roots 'n Table): Erica needs for the UI to be easy to navigate. She doesn't have a good sense for technology so she doesn't want to spend an hour trying to figure out what to do.</li>
				<li>Relevant technology: Erica has a computer but couldn't tell you what the brand was or the operating system (it's a Dell Inspiron that runs Windows 7). She also has an iPhone 6 but does most of her browsing/online shopping from home on her laptop.</li>

			<h3>User Story:</h3>
			<p>
				Erica is tired of her favorite foods running out at the farmers markets she goes to. She wants to be able to easily buy and reserve the food she wants online and go later to pick it up.

			<h3>Use Case:</h3>
			<p>
				Erica will be using our site mainly from her home on her Dell Inspiron which runs Windows 7 in order to secure her favorite foods before she goes to the farmers market. Occasionally she may access Roots 'n Table on her iPhone 6 if she forgets to go online in the morning but that will be a very rare case. She is a true farmers market frequent flyer and only wants to eat and buy local food so she will always go online and buy whatever she wants. She is also interested in finding out what farms she can buy and pick up from. She is technically challenged so the UI needs to be easy to navigate and she doesn't want to spend time trying to figure everything out.
