		<h1>Local Restaurant Owner </h1>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong>Benjamin Cook </p>
		<p><strong>Age: </strong> 29 </p>
		<p><strong>Occupation: </strong> Benjamin is a person that has always liked good food. His taste has driven him
			to start a small business in the food industry. His restaurant started operations 5 years ago and ever since,
			it has experienced a rapid growth. Benjamin has decided from the beginning to use only the best ingredients for
			his recipes, which is the main reason why people visits his establishment. Part of his personal and business
			life is aided by technology, he has a powerful MacBook Pro with OS X "El Capitan" and an Iphone 6 with IOS
			9.3.3 operative system.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong> Benjamin takes his business very seriously and likes to be involved
			in all stages of the process. He supervises everything, specially when it comes to his ingredients chain of
			supply. Nevertheless, he has already built trusting relationships with his suppliers through these years so he
			doesn't have to spend a lot of time overseeing the ingredients quality. </p>
		<p><strong> Needs and Frustrations: </strong>Benjamin is constantly looking for vegetable and animal products
			providers to satisfy the needs of his business, but lately, he's experiencing an increment on his business
			operations and his regular providers are unable to meet his demands. Therefore, he needs to find new sources
			for such ingredients and he suddenly is finding himself with less time to look for them. Currently, in order
			for him to satisfy his clients he had compromised quality in exchange to availability. Currently he needs to go
			to retail grocery stores (Smith's, Albertson's, Walmart) in order to make up for his needs; he feels disgusted
			by this method, but it helps him satify his day by day operations.</p>
		<p><strong> Goal: </strong> At this moment, Benjamin needs to find a bigger amount of the high quality ingredients
			he uses for his recipes and do it in a smaller amount of time. </p>
		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<p>Benjamin needs to find a way in which he can optimize his daily operations. Something that gives him access to
			vegetable and animal products in a way that doesn't take a lot of time. A tool where he can quickly learn about
			the product in a way that he can make an informed decision about purchasing. Finally, he needs to develop long
			term trust relationships with his new providers. Benjamin offers wi-fi to his customers and that
			means he has a very reliable and powerful connection. In addition he has a powerful MacBook Pro with OS X
			(10.11.6) "El Capitan" and an Iphone 6 with IOS 9.3.3 operative system.</p>
