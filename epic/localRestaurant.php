		<h2> Age 29 </h2>
		<h2> Description </h2>
		<p> Benjamin is a person that has always liked good food. His taste has driven him to start a small business in
			the food industry. His restaurant started operations 5 years ago and ever since, it has experienced a rapid
			growth. Benjamin has decided from the beginning to use only the best ingredients for his recipes. Such, is the
			main reason why people visits his establishment, but it is also the main struggle for Benjamin because high
			quality and highly fresh ingredients are hard to find. </p>
		<h2> Frustrations</h2>
		<p>Benjamin is constantly looking for vegetable and animal products providers to satisfy the needs of his
			business, but lately, he's experiencing an increment on his business operations and his regular providers are
			unable to meet his demands. Therefore, he needs to find new sources for such ingredients and he suddenly is
			finding himself with less time to look for them.</p>
		<h2> Goal </h2>
		<p> At this moment, Benjamin needs to find a bigger amount of the high quality ingredients he uses for his recipes
			and do it in a smaller amount of time. </p>
		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<p>Benjamin needs to find a way in which he can optimize his daily operations. Something that gives him access to
			vegetable and animal products in a way that doesn't take a lot of time. A tool where he can quickly learn about
			the product in a way that he can make an informed decision about purchasing. Finally, he needs to develop long
			term trust relationships with his new providers. Benjamin offers wi-fi to his customers and that
			means he has a very reliable and powerful connection. In addition he has a powerful MacBook Pro with OS X (10.11.6) "El
			Capitan" and an Iphone 6 with IOS 9.3.3 operative system.</p>
